This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## prop-calc-react

This is a pure React app that can be used to assess property investment proposals for
profitability. Stamp duty banding data is correct at time of writing (March 2019).

This is a front end app only. There is no persistence. Feel free to download code and 
make your own mods.

You can see the latest deployed build at
